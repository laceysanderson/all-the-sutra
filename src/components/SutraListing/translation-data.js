        "1.4": "At other times the Seer appears to assume the form of the modification of the mind.",
        "1.5": "They (modifications) fall into five varieties, of which some are 'Klista' and the rest 'Aklista'.",

        "1.8": "Viparyaya or illusion is false knowledge formed of a thing as other than what it is.",
        "1.9": "The modification called 'Vikalpa' is based on verbal cognition in regard to a thing which does not exist. (It is a kind of useful knowledge arising out of the meaning of a word but having no corresponding reality.)",
        "1.10": "Dreamless sleep is the mental modification produced by the condition of inertia as the state of vacuity or negation (of waking and dreaming).",
        "1.11": "Recollection is mental modification caused by reproduction of the previous impression of an object without adding anything from other sources."
